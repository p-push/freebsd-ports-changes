Chouwa is a library which aims to ease the integration of jinja2 into
django projects. It does this by providing equivalents of some of
django's helper methods which depend on its template subsystem, as well
as providing builtin globals and filters and providing a mechanism for
user applications to introduce their own globals and filters.
